Depot Meeting Summary 
27.10.2014 (12 - 14h) 

Participants: 
Keiko, Michael, Leander 

We discussed the division of work for the first three dates Depot offered in 2015. Furthermore, we spoke about the budget for the three events. For now we plan with â‚¬1500, which we split evenly between the three dates. All common costs such as promotion will be split. Due to the limited budget, the presenters or panel participants will most likely be from Vienna. Hence, the budget shall be used to cover the costs of transport in the city, a dinner and other production costs. 

TASK: After the Events are fixed on the 10.11.2014, we have to organize the Budget. 

Michael was assigned the responsibility to organize and host the event on 
Monday, 26 January 2015. The topic will be related to his research field, architecture and spirituality. 
A detailed description will follow. 

Leander was assigned to contact Doc Students which could be interested to host the event on the 27.02.2015. Furthermore, Leander will host and organize the event in March (10,13 or 16.03.2015). The topic will be related to his field of research: Cosmopolitics. A Detailed description will follow.
